# 201 First Project - Guessing Game

-- First Code 201 project, and first basic application of HTML and JavaScript.
-- Created a y/n guessing game about me, using prompts and alerts.
-- Streamlined responses to prompts by calling toLowerCase() method on user input (either y or n), to ensure all y or n            n answers, either upper or lower case, would be accepted.
-- Created a simple "resume" using basic HTML elements, like <p>, <h1>, <ul>, and <li>.
